To boost your sleep quality, consider reducing your caffeine intake, especially in the afternoon and evening, as caffeine can interfere with falling asleep. Also, increasing your exercise to at least 3-4 hours per week, ideally earlier in the day, can promote deeper and more restorative sleep. Your alcohol intake is moderate, but try to avoid drinking close to bedtime, as it can disrupt sleep cycles. Small adjustments can make a big difference—sweet dreams!\n"
